"""
Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

  1  All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
  2  All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
  3  Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".

Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way. 

Example 1:

Input: "USA"
Output: True


Example 2:

Input: "FlaG"
Output: False
